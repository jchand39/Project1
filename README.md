# Project 1
updated August 20th

## Submit to Web-CAT

1. Submit your project to Web-CAT under Project 1. 
2. Do not place your code in a java package. Your code should be in the default package.
3. Place Project1.java and Project1Test.java in the submit folder and submit that folder to Web-Cat using the submitter plugin in VS Code. Alternatively, you can upload that folder as a zip file to the Web-CAT submission page visible at the bottom of the assignment page in Canvas.
4. Do not submit any other files. If you submit other java file, they will be graded as part of the project and most likely you will lose points because you haven't tested them.

## Purpose & Objectives
An aspect of designing and writing effective data structures is using abstraction to define actions (methods) that work in a data collection, independently to a large extent, of the actual type of data stored in the collection.

* Gain familiarity with Generic classes
* Gain familiarity with collection classes
* Gain familiarity with functional predicates
* Gain familiarity with JUnit test cases
